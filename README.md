# ClassicBlurple
This theme for BetterDiscord will allow you to return (at least partially) to the old look of discord.

The theme so far only improves a few small elements. With each update I try to improve more.

**NOTICE:** Support for the theme is temporarily suspended. If discord completely implements the "newple" colour, perhaps support will be resumed.

## How to use?
1. Download files
2. enter user settings
3. category BetterDiscord -> Themes
4. Click "Open Themes Folder"
5. upload **ClassicBlurple.theme.css** file into it
6. Activate the theme.
